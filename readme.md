## Project Overview

Air pollution is a critical environmental challenge in India, with PM2.5 being one of the most harmful pollutants affecting public health. This project aims to develop an accurate forecasting system that can predict PM2.5 concentrations across the country to help authorities and citizens prepare for poor air quality events.

The model processes historical meteorological data and emission inventories to forecast PM2.5 levels 16 hours into the future at a spatial resolution covering the entire Indian subcontinent (140×124 grid).

## Methodology

Our approach combines several advanced techniques:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Log transformation for skewed emission features
   - Z-score normalization for all variables
   - Episode detection using statistical methods

2. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - Convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture
   - Multi-scale spatial encoding with dilated convolutions
   - Physics-informed wind warping for advection modeling
   - Attention mechanisms for spatial focus

3. **Training Strategy**:
   - Combined loss function optimizing multiple metrics
   - Episode-weighted training for extreme events
   - Teacher forcing with scheduled decay
   - Early stopping with patience mechanism

## Model Architecture

The forecasting model implements a sophisticated encoder-decoder architecture:

### Encoder
Processes 10-hour historical data:
- ConvLSTM layers for temporal processing
- Multi-scale dilated convolutions for spatial context
- Hidden state initialization for sequence processing

### Decoder
Autoregressively predicts 16 future time steps:
- Wind warping module using physics-based advection
- Episode detection from hidden states
- Spatial attention mechanism
- Residual connections for stable training

### Key Components

1. **ConvLSTM Cell**: Processes spatiotemporal sequences with gated recurrent units
2. **Spatial Encoder**: Multi-scale feature extraction using dilated convolutions
3. **Wind Warp Module**: Physics-informed transport modeling using wind vectors
4. **Episode Detector**: Identifies high pollution event regions
5. **Spatial Attention**: Focuses on relevant spatial regions
6. **Output Head**: Generates final PM2.5 predictions with uncertainty quantification

## Key Features

- **Multi-variable Input Processing**: Handles 15 meteorological and emission variables
- **Episode-aware Training**: Special weighting for high pollution events
